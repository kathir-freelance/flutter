int  n=90;

return n>180? A:B;

step 1:

void getData(){
//later we can add api 
//to delay and get reply in few seconds we use Future.delayed

	Future.delayed(Duration(seconds:3),(){
		print('hello!!!');
	});//non-blocking code
	Future.delayed(Duration(seconds:2),(){
		print('hi how are you');
	});
	print('outside!!!');
}
	//call abv function in initState
	initState(){
		getData();
	}
}

o/p :
outside!!!	
hi how are you
hello!!!

above scenario is sync

to make it async,ie add async to getData

void getData() async{}

use await if u want tht first delayed to print first and then only second 
delayed code shud work. use as below

	String s1=await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds:3),(){
		print('hello!!!');
	});

then print outside should be printed out? use await for tht too
String s2=await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds:3),(){
		print('hi how are you');
	});

if u keep print in initSTate:

that will be called first then prints getData

print data in s1 and s2 in getData
