1.  convert a for into while
2.  infinite forloop
3.  sum of two digit number => 

	i/p 25
	o/p should be 7

4. i/p is 123.34.3.0

	o/p shud be valid ip or invlaid ip

	hints: 
		totally 4 div must be there
		each div shud range b/w 0-255
5. i/p is 152 (input can be any number between 1-1000)


	o/p -> one five two

6. i/p is 152 (input can be any number between 1-1000)	 

	o/p -> one hundred and fifty two

7. using ternary print number is even or odd

8. replace alternative(odd) character by * in a given string ( string can be hardcoded )
9. find fibbonacci of a number
10. print o/p in below format

a.
*

* * * * 

b. 
	
     	     *
	*         *
