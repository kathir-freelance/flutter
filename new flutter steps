1: import material.dart;
2. have main method
3. create a class and extend stateless widget
4. use text widget, scaffold,center color etc as in prev notepad file
5. can we add multiple Text for one widget eg:

	2 Text widget in child of center or body:?

yes its possible by using layout or control(invisible)

	row , column etc
6. add multiple Text or button using column
7. add functions into button

	like arrow, anonymous or normal function. on pressing print something in console
if u connect same function to all on pressed went then logically it ll be wrong
as they ll print same msg for choosing diff ans.
so we use arrow or anonymous function.


8.now that we can create a questionaire app

in the abv code , add this below chngs

var questions=['qn1?','qn2?']; add below fucntion build()


this has to dynamically change on clicking answer 1 2 3 buttons in the place whre we gave
Text('questions');


so change it to Text(questions.elementAt(0)) //its hardcoded
so make it dynamic

create a variable index below class and increment it in answerQn method
and u can see qn is not chnaging.. y?
even the index goes beyond 1 no error like when we did manually chnaging value to 0,1,2...
range error we got. but now we are not getting anything? y?

this is where we make use of statefull widget.

9. Stateful widget - state?

state is data or info ur application use (refer desktop img 3);

manage state by making use of stateful widget and state class. do the following chnages
============================================================
refer img4 for difference b/w stateless and statefull
============================================================

to avoid usage of myappstate use private (using _ symbol before class name and property and function of the class)
